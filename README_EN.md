# DSH Insider

[中文](README.md) | English

DSH Insider is a read-only Runtime Explorer for DeepSeek Harness. It ships as
one independent, dual-face DSH plugin: the Host face projects Cordis runtime
state and privacy-safe session-event metadata, while the Web face renders the
graph and request trace. The overview also exposes per-plugin Effect activity
as Current, Delta, Churn, trend, and bounded recent lifecycle transitions.

## Screenshots

### Runtime overview

The overview combines process health, Cordis contexts, Effect activity, Agent
turns, events, and per-plugin lifecycle trends.

Plugin, Fiber, and Service distributions expose the same runtime state by
status and plugin type.

### Relationship graph

The graph visualizes DSH plugins and Cordis services as typed nodes, with
dependency, provider, consumer, injection, and missing-provider relationships.

Select a plugin to inspect its runtime identity and neighborhood, or filter the
graph down to every registered service node.

### Request trace

Request Trace groups captured metadata by Session and Agent Turn before opening
the detailed event flow for a selected turn.

## Install

Install the public package into a Web profile, then restart that profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @howardchan/dsh-insider
```

No Harness source edit or central Remote registry edit is required.

When upgrading from `@howardchan/dsh-runtime`, remove the old package before
installing the new one so both Bundles cannot register the gateway and UI at
the same time. Saved graph layouts remain compatible.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove @howardchan/dsh-runtime
dsh plugin --profile web add @howardchan/dsh-insider
```

## Packages

- `packages/dsh-insider`: the only publishable package, named `@howardchan/dsh-insider`.
- `packages/runtime`: private Host source/build unit.
- `packages/ui-runtime`: private Web source/build unit.

The public package carries the Host gateway, Web UI, generated Remote
contribution, and Bundle patch.

## Current development baseline

Version 0.1.0 was extracted from DeepSeek Harness commit `141eb6fef8` and was
validated against the local Harness `0.1.0-rc.8` package family. npm currently
exposes only the older `0.0.1-rc.1` DSH family, so source builds and tests must
run in a sibling checkout of the matching Harness baseline for now. The
prebuilt `lib/` artifacts and assembled public package keep the repository
inspectable and packable. The DSH peers remain optional because the selected
profile supplies them at runtime; installation still requires a compatible
DSH `0.1.0-rc.8` family rather than the older public npm family.

See [integration/README.md](integration/README.md) for the exact integration
boundary.

## Verification

```sh
npm run verify
npm run pack:dry-run
```

The independent Bundle tests run in this repository. Browser integration tests
are kept with the Web source unit and run in the matching Harness checkout.

## Privacy boundary

The trace stores metadata only: session id, event type, sequence, time, lane,
turn, step, call id, tool name, outcome, and serialized payload size. Prompt
text, model output, tool arguments, tool results, and failure messages are not
exposed by the runtime snapshot.
