# DSH Insider

[中文](README.md) | English

DSH Insider is an independent Runtime Explorer for DeepSeek Harness and Cordis. The package is a
single dual-face DSH Bundle: its Host face projects runtime state and its Web
face renders Runtime Overview, the relationship graph, and request traces.

Install it into a Web profile, then restart that profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @howardchan/dsh-insider
```

When upgrading, remove `@howardchan/dsh-runtime` before installing
`@howardchan/dsh-insider`. Saved graph layouts remain compatible.

The current `0.1.3` build targets the DSH `0.1.0-rc.8` package family.
